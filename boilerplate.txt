	// Place your snippets for python here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"boilerplate": {
		"prefix": "bilerplate code",
		"body": [
			"import numpy as np",
			"from pyspark.sql import Row",
			"from pyspark.sql import SparkSession",
			"import pandas as pd",
			"import random",
			"import matplotlib.pyplot as plt",
			"import seaborn as sns",
            "spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()",
			"df = spark.createDataFrame(pd.read_json("")),
			"df",
			"df.show()",
			"df.printSchema()
			"$2"

		"description": "Log output to console"
